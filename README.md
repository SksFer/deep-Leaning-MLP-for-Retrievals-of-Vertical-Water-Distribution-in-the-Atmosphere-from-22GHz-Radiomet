We present an optimization of the retrieval calculation for a 22 GHz Water Vapor Radiometer. The power of the emission line is intrinsically related to the vertical profile of water vapor, allowing us to determine the amount of water vapor through spectral analysis. Previous work obtained this by calculating the inverse Jacobian matrix, a complex and computationally expensive method. As an alternative, we propose using a Multi-Layer Perceptron.
